    "problem_statement": "A full-stack application is needed to allow users to define customizable IF-THEN rules as personal laws, which can conflict and override each other, creating a dynamic rule engine. This system must algorithmically evaluate any user-provided scenario by applying all relevant rules, detecting conflicts, and resolving overrides to produce a single, deterministic outcome. Furthermore, the application must clearly present the complete reasoning path, explaining which rules fired and how any conflicts were resolved, to provide users with transparent, explainable decision-making.",
