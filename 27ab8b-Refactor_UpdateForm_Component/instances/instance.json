    "problem_statement": "The current UpdateForm component requires a refactor because it lacks essential validation, proper error handling, and sound architectural structure, making it unreliable and difficult to maintain. It allows submissions with an empty or invalid ID, does not validate that the ID matches a MongoDB ObjectId format, and permits update requests even when no actual fields are provided to change. Input values are not trimmed before processing, and the update payload is not built selectively, which can result in incorrect or unnecessary API requests. All API errors are logged to the console instead of being displayed to users, leaving them without meaningful feedback for issues such as invalid input or a song not being found. The component also lacks a loading indicator, does not disable the submit button during requests, and fails to reset success messages when the form is edited again. Additionally, there is no request cancellation support, which can lead to memory leaks if the component unmounts mid-request. From an architectural standpoint, the component directly uses axios instead of a reusable service layer, relies on outdated CommonJS imports, duplicates input handlers, and lacks proper TypeScript typing for API interactions. These issues collectively result in poor user experience, weak reliability, and unmaintainable code, making a structured refactor necessary to ensure a clean, accessible, and production-ready implementation.",
