    "problem_statement": "When the viewport is reduced to mobile sizes, all footer content—including the brand description, navigation links, and contact information—shifts excessively to the left instead of remaining visually centered. Additionally, the social media icons appear immediately after the brand description within the first column, disrupting the expected content flow on mobile layouts. The desktop layout must remain intact, preserving the grid structure, Tailwind CSS styling, hover effects, transitions, and semantic HTML.",
