    "problem_statement": "Create a Python error handling and input validation library with a structured hierarchy of categorized errors, severity levels, and reusable validator functions. The library must include centralized error handling with logging and filtering, plus decorators for safe execution and retry logic, all fully tested for validation rules and error scenarios. It should be modular with a clean folder structure separating enums, errors, validators, handlers, and decorators into distinct packages.",
