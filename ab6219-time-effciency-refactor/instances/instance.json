    "problem_statement": "Refactor the given Python function to improve time efficiency. The function should find all unique pairs of numbers in a list that sum up to a given target value. The current implementation is O(n^2) in time complexity, but can be optimized to O(n) using a hash table. The refactored function should maintain the same functionality and output, but with improved performance.",
