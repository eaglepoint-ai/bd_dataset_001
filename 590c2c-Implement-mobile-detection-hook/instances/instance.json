    "problem_statement": "The application needs a reliable way to determine if the user is on a mobile device based on screen width. Current approaches are either not reactive, fail to update on window resize, or cause hydration mismatches during server-side rendering (SSR). There is a need for a reusable React hook, useIsMobile, that: Uses a 768px breakpoint to define mobile devices. Reacts to window resizing to keep the state up-to-date. Is SSR-safe by initializing the state as undefined to prevent hydration errors. Cleans up event listeners when the component unmounts. Returns a boolean value indicating whether the user is on a mobile device. This hook will provide a consistent, efficient, and safe solution for responsive behavior throughout the application.",
