    "problem_statement": "A TypeScript system must be designed to emulate the App Router by dynamically constructing a route map from a file tree, where directories become path segments and specially named files like `page.tsx` become renderable endpoints. This architecture requires a module to parse the file system, matching incoming URL requests to the correct file path by interpreting dynamic parameters (e.g., `[slug]`) and supporting nested layouts through files like `layout.tsx`. The implementation must prioritize type safety for route parameters and the composition of parallel and nested layouts, delivering the correct React component for a matched request.",
