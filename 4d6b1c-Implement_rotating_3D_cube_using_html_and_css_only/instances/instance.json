    "problem_statement": "Create a fully functional, visually polished 3D rotating cube using only HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript or external libraries. The cube should rotate smoothly along the X, Y, and Z axes, demonstrating true 3D depth, while each face features a modern glassmorphism design with high transparency, subtle backdrop-filter: blur(), semi-transparent white borders, and soft inner glows. The cube must be perfectly centered on a dark gradient background, remain responsive across different screen sizes, and the entire implementation should be contained within a single HTML file with all necessary CSS included.",
