  "problem_statement": "Build a production-ready URL shortener for a startup expecting 10,000 URLs and 1M redirects/month. The application requires a React frontend with Vite for URL submission with optional custom codes and a table displaying all URLs with click counts. The Express backend needs CRUD endpoints, SQLite persistence with indexed lookups, URL validation, and custom code rules (4-20 chars, alphanumeric plus hyphens, no reserved words). Click counts must increment on each redirect, and all data must persist across server restarts.",
