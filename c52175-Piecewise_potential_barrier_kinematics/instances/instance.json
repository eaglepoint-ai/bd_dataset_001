  "problem_statement": "Determine the time-to-impact for an object released from rest at $y=150$ m within a dual-zone gravitational field. The environment enforces repulsive gravity ($a = +9.8$ m/s²) for all altitudes above a $100$ m threshold and attractive gravity ($a = -9.8$ m/s²) for altitudes at or below that threshold. The model must strictly adhere to these vectors, acknowledging that the repulsive zone may prevent the object from ever entering the attractive region.",
