  "problem_statement": "The source code is intentionally obfuscated using cryptic naming and redundant anonymous function wrappers, hiding the logic of a real-time collaborative editor. This 'syntactic noise' makes the system—which relies on delicate WebSocket synchronization, MongoDB persistence, and a thread-safe caching layer—extremely difficult to audit or maintain. The goal is to strip these layers and restore idiomatic Go readability without breaking the underlying concurrency model or database synchronization.",
