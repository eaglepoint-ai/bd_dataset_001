# Refactoring and Optimizing the Numerical Validator

This repository demonstrates a "Numerical Integrity Engine" - an over-engineered C++ implementation that validates if a number is a power of two. The `repository_before` directory contains the baseline bloated code, while `repository_after` is reserved for the optimized implementation.

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Quick Start

### 1. Run Tests for `repository_before`

```bash
docker compose run --rm app
```

### 2. Run Tests for `repository_after`

```bash
# No tests to run
```

### 3. Run Evaluations

```bash
# No tests to run
```
