    "problem_statement": "The real-time enterprise chat application suffers from critical performance and memory issues when handling large conversations of 10,000+ messages, leading to UI freezes, excessive CPU usage, and high memory consumption. The root cause is inefficient React rendering behavior, where every keystroke in the input field updates parent state and triggers a full re-render of all message components due to changing callback references and object identities. As a result, expensive markdown rendering executes repeatedly for unchanged messages, severely degrading responsiveness and driving customer churn. The challenge is to redesign the rendering and memoization strategy—without altering the component hierarchy or removing features—so that only messages with actual data changes re-render. The solution must preserve full real-time functionality while achieving strict performance, memory, and responsiveness targets at scale.",
