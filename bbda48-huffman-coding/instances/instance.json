    "problem_statement": "A Python program must be developed to implement Huffman coding, starting by reading a text file specified via command line to calculate character frequencies and build a canonical Huffman tree using a priority queue. The system must then generate optimal binary codes through a tree traversal, encode the original text, and output a complete table listing each character's frequency and corresponding Huffman code. Finally, the implementation must calculate and display the original and encoded bit counts along with the compression ratio, all within a strict 150-line constraint and with robust error handling for edge cases like empty or single-character files.",
