    "problem_statement": "The task is to build a personal blog website that dynamically generates all content from Markdown files, eliminating hardcoded HTML. The site should feature a landing page displaying the blogger’s information from a dedicated Markdown file and automatically list and render individual blog posts stored in a structured /blogs directory, each with metadata like title, date, and tags. The system must convert Markdown to HTML for display, support a single-page application experience, and ensure that all content—including posts and site info—is fully driven by Markdown files, providing a lightweight, maintainable, and content-focused blogging platform.",
